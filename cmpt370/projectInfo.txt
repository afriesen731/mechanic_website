Project infomation:

Rules:

Mechanic:


ignore this:
1. They should be able to work on 1 job at a time, meaning only 1 clock should be running
 at a time, but they should be able to switch if they want if a clock on a job isnt running. 
2. A mechanic can skip jobs, as long. as all are done, thats all that matters,
doesnt have to be in sequence.
3. Once they have inputted a work order number, they sshould see a list of all the pending
or in progress work orders.
4. A comment for each job must be added,  but a part shouldnt be required,
as some jobs dont require new parts, but each job must have a comment, and some have both.
5. If a type of service is selected, that means the mechanic will be looking for faults 
in a truck, meaning; when a type of service is selected eg: Truck PMA, they should be able 
to ADD a jobs, and once the PMA inspection has been done, and all new jobs are inserted BY
 THE MECHANIC, he should then be able to work on that same work order, with the jobs HE created.
